Plantae - Tracheophyta - Ginkgoopsida - Ginkgoales	Ginkgos	This dataset represents a part extracted from the database of the National Museum Prague. It was prepared by Jiří Kvaček with help of Olexandra Chernomorets. The dataset comprises all described unequivocal fossil members of the Ginkgoales (fossil plant remains which could be assigned to this group with certainty). It is based on reproductive structures assigned to Ginkgoales and their associated organs. As a part of this dataset there are main taxa of foliage and wood structures assigned to the group with high degree of probability. Additional taxa of Ginkgoales are a part of another version, which is in state of preparation.	National Museum, Prague, Czech Republic	http://www.nm.cz	Global	100	5		Jiří Kvaček
