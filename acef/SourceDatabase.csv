Data was drawn from a web-based checklist that since 2005 was available through CSIRO Australia, but which for technical reasons has had to be abandoned. ""Thysanoptera (Thrips) of the World - a checklist"" originated from card-catalogues maintained over many years at the Natural History Museum, London, and at the Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt. GBIF funded visits to check data at the major thrips collections in Frankfurt, London and Washington DC for the 2005 system. The available data has been extensively revised and enriched through bibliographic and web searches, and production of this new site was supported by DAFF Australia.
